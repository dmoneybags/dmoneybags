 > If I don't know it, I can learn it
 
Coming from a family of programmers I became interested in programming a couple years ago and began coding websites with a Django backend. After getting a grasp on
CSS, Javascript, and HTML, I moved onto coding arduinos with C++ and working with circuits (Although it's a later example check out the "BLE Sensor" repo). Now,
I mostly work on creative applications of TensorFlow and Keras, such as reinforcement learning algorithms to play my favorite games (Pokemon, 2048), and applications
within the medical field (ECGNet). If anyone reading this wants to check out some of my code and help me out, go ahead! The Repos are public for a reason.
